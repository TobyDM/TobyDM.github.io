Musical Mechatronics Project
Te Herenga Waka Victoria University of Wellington
I completed my undergraduate degree spending my last semester studying abroad in Wellington, New Zealand. My focus in mechanical engineering and musical interests coalesced into a semester-long project, where I designed and built a novel musical instrument: a software controlled slide whistle. The device communicated via MIDI, allowing it to be controlled by any digital audio workstation. It operated with a closed loop control system using a microphone as the feedback input. A video of a creative application with this instrument can be found below, as well as a link to my final report detailing all aspects of the project.
