Musical Mechatronics Project
Te Herenga Waka Victoria University of Wellington
This semester long individual project that involved the creation of a novel musical instrument created by connecting electronic and mechanical components to a slide whistle uses MIDI input signals from a digital audio workstation and a closed loop feedback control system using a microphone to produce repeatable, in tune pitch that can be used in music creation. A video of a creative application with this instrument can be found below
