Music
Albums Written, Recorded, Mixed, and Mastered by Myself
I grew up playing music, but didn't see the full extent of my potential until I explored the world of digital music production. Over years of exploring the software and creating various songs, I grew my skills and confidence and began to create full length albums. I have released 4 full length albums, all available on all streaming platforms under the name Diarchipretti.
