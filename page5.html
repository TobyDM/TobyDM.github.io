</h2><h3>Projects Created from 2019 to Present
</h3><p>Graphic design became a hobby of mine towards the end of high school, and I started to gain confidence in the tools and my eye for design after I started taking graphic design courses at Cal Poly. These courses included a series in graphic design principles, a series in Typography, and a course in interaction and UX design. All images were generated by myself using the Adobe Creative Suite.</p></span></div>
