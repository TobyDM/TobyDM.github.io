				<h3>Bathtub Full Of Apricots</h3>
				<h4>Play Brochure, Advertisement, and Ticket Design</h4>
				<p>"Bathtub Full of Apricots" was a black-box theater production from Oak Tech Rep packed full of two-minute-long, neo-futurist skits. The brochure for this play was extremely important to the production as audience members would call out the plays they would like to hear from the list they were given in their programs.</p>
				<p>I worked with a small group of designers on all the graphic content for this play, and we were able to give the materials a consistent graphic aesthetic. Work in the watercolor, layout, and concepts for the poster avertisements was evenly split between me and my colleagues, while all the digital design was done by me.</p>
