				<h3>Saul Bass</h3>
				<h4>Magazine Article</h4>
				<p>The challenge of this project was to tell a clear and informative story, with words and images working together. Note the alignment of the blocks of text that allows your eye to travel down the page without questioning where to move next. All of the graphics on the page were created by Saul Bass himself, and add up in the reader's mind to give an impression of the influence of this visionary creator.</p>
