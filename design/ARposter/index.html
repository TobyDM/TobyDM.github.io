				<h3>Midnight Hike</h3>
				<h4>Augmented Reality Poster</h4>
				<p>This project used the program <a href="https://artivive.com/" target="_blank">Artivive</a> to map a moving animation to a print of the poster. This allows users to to point their phone at the poster and see parts of it come to life.</p>
				<p>About the art: In an aura of self-realization in the wake of leaving home for college, I began to take time for myself. I took many walks in the middle of the night, and was happy to experience life from an independent point of view. Along with this came strong feelings both darkness and love for myself. This piece emulates those feelings, contrasting the darkness of the moon with the brighness of the sunflower; the confidence of "I AM MY OWN PERSON" with the unsure nature of "AM I MY OWN?".</p>
